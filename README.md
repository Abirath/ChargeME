# ChargeME
An Android app to find electric charger points. 

The App was created as part of my post-graduate diploma final assignment - for Android development course. 
The App detects the user's location co-ordinates and uses it as input to a public API endpoint to identify electric charger points locations. 
The App displays the list of available charger points in a recycler-view. 
The maps integration is partially implemented and has future plans to finish the implementation completely.
